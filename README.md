# Introduction

For the 25+ years the web has existed, we have seen it evolve to become more than a publishing platform. Now we see the web supporting vast majority of businesses. We have also seen the tools surrounding the web evolve as well, from manually creating multiple web pages to automating them with scripts to using frameworks.

These tools improve overtime to support the demand of the ever growing web. but then the web has grown beyond pages. But the best of tools specifically web frameworks we have where built for the web never for mobile app backend and IOT in mind. 

This leaves mobile and IOT developers having to depend hugely on web developers to work on their backends. 
We felt like there is a need for mobile developers to be able to build their own backends without having to tweak what was meant for the web.  

DevLess sets out to join the evolution of the backend frameworks. And yes there are newer backend solutions but most are offered as a service. We believe that you should be handed a log to make your own boat rather than have you use an already made boat like most solutions out there that are SAAS based.

[**DevLess**](https://devless.io) is an open source backend as a service for mobile web and IOT application developers to rapidly develop their backend services and generate api endpoints with ease. You can check it out @ https://devless.io.

All that is required of the developer is to write the frontend code ([*JavaScript*](https://www.javascript.com/), [*Android*](https://developer.android.com)\[[*Java*](https://java.com/en/download/)\], iOS\[[*Swift*](https://swift.org/)/[*Objective C*](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)\], etc.) to consume the API endpoints. If the developer's required features isn’t available, he or she can build the module (service with a lean view) and share with the world through the Service Hub.
